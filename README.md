**ü©∫ Skin Disease Detection using Deep Learning**

*Overview*

This project leverages the power of deep learning to detect and classify skin diseases from images. By analyzing patterns and features in medical images, the model can provide an initial assessment that aids healthcare professionals in diagnosing conditions more efficiently.

This system is designed to work as a decision-support tool and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

*Features*

üñºÔ∏è Image Classification: Detect multiple skin disease types from input images.
üß† Deep Learning Model: Built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high accuracy.
üìä Performance Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
üåê User Interface (Optional): A simple interface to upload images for detection (if applicable).

*Technologies Used*

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV
Dataset: ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) Dataset or any custom dataset
Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

*How it Works*

Dataset Preprocessing:

Images are resized, normalized, and augmented for training.
Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Architecture:

A CNN model with layers optimized for feature extraction.
Utilizes techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Training:

The model is trained on labeled images using categorical cross-entropy loss.
Hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are fine-tuned for optimal performance.
Prediction:

Input images are processed, and the model outputs the predicted disease category with confidence scores.

*How to Run*

Setup Environment

Psoriasis: ‚ùå
Melanoma: ‚ùå

*Future Enhancements*

Incorporate more skin disease categories for broader applicability.
Improve the user interface for non-technical users.
Integrate with mobile apps for on-the-go diagnosis.
Train the model on a larger, more diverse dataset to reduce bias.
